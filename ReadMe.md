## Note: 
	- Due to lack of time for this project:
		- The Library project does not have full functions of a Library.
		- The Library project does not have serialization function - it has to be reinitialize every time executing.
		- The Library project does not have deserialization function - it would not save the changing for next time executing.
		- The Library project does not use many STL libraries as expected. 
		- The Library project still need to be improved with C++ technique.  
		- The Library project uses mostly C programming techniques.
